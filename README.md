# Static Enigma
I wanted a version of the [Enigma](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55558c2a44dad6b80f000088?query=Enigma&section=watchfaces) watchface without the animations to save battery (plus, I rarely saw the animation anyway.) and [Slides of time](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/555283c7efff0cc8e50000b0?query=Enigma&section=watchfaces) had too many extra features I didn’t want. So I made this. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Original design by Alex Kirov and watchface published by Neal Patel.

Licensed under the WTFPL... But, in bird culture, publishing this to the app store is considered a dick move. Then again, do whatever you want.
